# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `Cli.suspend(run)` hands the terminal to another program while `run`
  runs, one that reads the terminal itself (`sudo` asking for a password, a
  package manager, a pager, an editor), and takes it back after. The inline
  session's region stays with the cursor on the line below it, raw mode is
  off and the session's input paused, and the session is drawn again below
  what was printed. Such a program used to print in the middle of the
  region and never get what was typed.
- A line `Cli` logs or writes while its inline session is still opening
  (`cli.info` right after `cli.progress`) goes above the session once it is
  open. It was written to stdout while the opening session flushed it, and
  threw "StreamSink is bound to a stream".
- In visual order, where a row of right-to-left text is drawn as it reads,
  a click finds the target drawn under it: the crumb of `Breadcrumbs`, the
  segment of `SegmentedButton`, the page of `Pagination`, the step of
  `Stepper`, the arrow of `ValueStepper`, the key of a pressable
  `KeyHintsBar`, and a `ChipList` chip's `×`, which a click on the label
  took for it while the `×` was drawn on the left. They found it in a table
  of columns summed in stored order; they now ask the row's paragraph which
  text it drew there (`RenderParagraph.cellAt`). The hidden cursor rests
  on the active one where it is drawn too: `ActiveItem(text: (start, end))`
  rests it on the first cell its child `Text` draws of that text, found at
  each layout, as `column` gives a fixed one.

- The drawn mark of a theme field is one module: `Marks` (a `CellMark` or
  `TextMark` descriptor for each mark of `Glyphs`) and `ThemeMarks`
  (`ThemeMarks.of(context).text(Marks.close)`; in a render object
  `ThemeMarks.ofObject(this, canvas.segmenter).cell(Marks.cursor, glyphs)`),
  which keeps the one width rule (a mark is used only where it is one column
  and one code point, else it is `Glyphs.ascii`'s), a cache for each
  segmenter and the one warning for each (field, glyph). `Glyphs` stays
  plain strings. The helpers `cellRune`, `optionalCellRune`, `textMark`,
  `checkboxMarks`, `switchMarks`, `radioMarks`, `buttonEdgeMarks` and
  `lineMark` (internal, hidden from the exports) and `rampOf` are gone, as
  are the private copies of the rule in the charts, the dot grid, the
  skeleton, the scrollbar, the menu, the split, the window and twk_rich.
  Behaviour that the one rule changes:
  - a mark in text is checked wherever it is drawn: the close of a `Chip`,
    `Callout` and `Window`, the arrows of a `ValueStepper`, a `Pagination`
    (`previous`, `next`), the `separator` and `check` of a
    `SegmentedButton`, the `up` and `down` of a `NumberInput`, a `Select`
    and a `DatePicker`, the kind icons of a `StatusMessage`, a `Callout` and
    a toast, the `cursor` of a list and a file picker, the `expanded` and
    `collapsed` of an `ExpansionTile`, the `next` of `Breadcrumbs`, the
    `bullet` mask of a `TextField`, the radio brackets, and the marks of
    twk_rich's markdown (bullets, checkboxes, quote bar, table borders and
    lines) and diff; one that is two columns wide is the ASCII one, with one
    warning, where it was drawn as it was and shifted the row;
  - the dash drawn as text in a row (a `Stepper`, a `Callout`'s title, a
    raised `Window`'s minimise) is ASCII where the line is not one column;
  - a `Window`'s focus mark with an empty `cursor` draws nothing, where it
    drew `>`; a `Slider` with an empty `trackHorizontal` draws a blank, where
    it drew `-`, as a `Scrollbar` does;
  - a `SkeletonTheme(glyph:)` or a light shade that is not one column wide is
    the ASCII shade `.` (with one warning), where the skeleton drew a blank
    in reverse video;
  - `LineGauge(type:)` under `Glyphs.ascii` (lines ASCII) is ASCII, as the
    docs of `Glyphs` said: the ASCII theme beats a widget's `BorderType`;
  - a `Split` and a menu keep a border type whose pieces are all one column
    (as the charts do), where they kept it by the terminal's ambiguous
    width.
- `FocusNode.takesText` (and `Focus(takesText:)`) says that a node takes the
  keys that are characters as text: `TextField` and `TextArea` say it unless
  read-only. `FocusManagerKeys.activeKeys`, so a `KeyHintsBar` and
  `showKeyHelp`, no longer list a binding of a layer above such a node on a
  character key (`q`), which the field takes, and a click on a hint cannot
  type it into the field; keys with Ctrl or Alt stay.
- `KeyBindings(unmatched: UnmatchedKeys.replay)` replays the held first keys
  to the nodes a key walks, past what a dialog's `keysSkip` skips, where it
  gave them to the app's bindings between the navigator and the dialog.
- A cell's style id is a `StyleId` (package:twk_core, exported by
  package:twk), apart from a pen id, which stays an int: the effect cell's
  `EffectCell.style`, `childStyle` and `underStyle` are one, and so are
  the style arguments of a `RenderEffect`'s `effectCell`.
- `Scrollbar` and the bar of `Box` read the axis from the scrollable
  inside, as Flutter's `Scrollbar` does. `Scrollbar(axis:)` is nullable and
  null by default: the outermost scrollable of either axis, where it was
  vertical by default. So `Scrollbar()` around content whose outermost
  scrollable is horizontal now shows that one, in a row at the bottom; to
  keep the column around content that scrolls both ways, give
  `axis: Axis.vertical`. A given axis picks that axis's scrollable, the
  bar to each axis of content that scrolls both. An inner scrollable of the
  other axis never takes the bar of an outer one.
- `Box(scrollbar:)` takes a `ScrollbarVisibility?`, as `LogView` does,
  where it took an `Axis?`: `.always`, `.onScroll` (the border's own line
  shows while the thumb is hidden) or `.never`; null for none. The bar is on
  the right side for a vertical scrollable and on the bottom for a
  horizontal one; the border must have that side and a bottom title cannot
  share it with a horizontal bar, as asserted.

## 0.1.0

The first release.

- The framework: `Widget`, `StatelessWidget`, `StatefulWidget` and
  `State`, `InheritedWidget`, keys and `GlobalKey`, `LayoutBuilder`,
  `BuildContext`; `ChangeNotifier`, `ValueNotifier` and `Listenable`.
- `runApp`: fullscreen, inline below the shell's history (`Static`
  commits finished lines into the scrollback) or in a fixed viewport;
  `AppBinding` with frame callbacks, notifications, the window title and
  hot reload through `twk run`.
- Style and text: `Style` with colors, attributes, underline colors and
  links; `Text` and `Text.rich`, wrapping, ellipsis and bidirectional
  text; `Theme` with built-in dark and light themes, the default ones
  picked by the terminal's background, `Theme.adaptive` to choose them
  and `Theme.terminal` for the terminal's own colors.
- Layout: `Row`, `Column`, `Flex`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `Wrap`, `Box` with
  borders that merge, `Padding`, `Align`, `SizedBox`, `SplitView`.
- Focus and input: the focus tree, `Focus`, `KeyBindings`, `Shortcuts`
  and hinted keys; the mouse by hit test (`Listener`, `MouseRegion`).
- Scrolling and data: `ListView`, `Scrollbar`, `Table` (also over a data
  source), `TreeView`, `DirectoryTree`, charts, sparklines and gauges.
- Editing: `TextField`, `TextArea`, `Form` and `FormField`.
- Overlays: dialogs, menus, `MenuBar`, `ContextMenu`, toasts, tooltips,
  `CommandPalette`.
- Navigation and controls: `Navigator` and routes, tabs, buttons,
  switches, checkboxes, radio groups, sliders, `Stepper`, progress bars
  and spinners.
- Animation: tickers, `AnimationController`, implicit animations.
- Semantics and a screen-reader mode; debug aids: the frame overlay, the
  repaint rainbow, the log console, tree dumps and VM service extensions.
- Program output with ANSI sequences as styled text: `parseAnsi`,
  `AnsiStream` as it arrives, and `stripAnsi`.
- `package:twk/hooks.dart`, hooks in the flutter_hooks style, and
  `package:twk/provider.dart`, Provider's API.
- `package:twk/cli.dart`, the console of a command-line tool that is no
  app: messages by level, any widget printed, prompts, progress and a
  traceback, as a terminal, a pipe or CI takes them.
- A dart2wasm build for the web.
